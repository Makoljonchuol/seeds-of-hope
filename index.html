           <div class="about-content">
               <div class="about-text">
                   <h3>How It All Began (2019-2021)</h3>
                   <p>Returning to Kakuma in June 2021, after completing my high school education, was a plunge into the unexpected. Having graduated in 2019 with high hopes for college, the sharp reality hit hard - the odds were stacked against me. The Kenyan government's policies offered limited opportunities for "foreign students" like myself.</p>
                   
                   <p>Desperate for a way forward, I grasped onto the chance to teach within the refugee camp. Simultaneously, I became part of the <strong>Elimisha Kakuma program</strong>, headed by three former refugees who pursued education in the United States. At the camp, I shared a bed with a fellow teacher, while fourteen other young boys in our compound looked to me for guidance and education.</p>
                   
                   <p>Each morning, I would go to the Elimisha Center, assuming the role of both a tech support member and a student. Weekends were dedicated to volunteering in schools and hospitals, peeling back layers of this community's reality. <strong>I discovered a harsh truth: many children in the camp faced the raw challenges of refugee life alone.</strong></p>
                   
                   <h3>Building a Family (2021-2023)</h3>
                   <p>In Kakuma, numerous young souls arrive unaccompanied, thrown into a community where living alone is not an option. I met <strong>three boys</strong> who had no family, no shelter, and no support. Their names stayed with me, and their need became my responsibility.</p>
                   
                   <p>With community fundraising, I built a small shelter for them. We added solar panels for light and safety, provided daily meals, and enrolled them in school. Word spread. More children came - children who had lost everything but hope. <strong>At our peak, we were supporting 18 children.</strong> We taught them life skills, discipline, and community values. It wasn't perfect, but it was a home.</p>
                   
                   <h3>The Crisis of 2025</h3>
                   <p>In early 2025, <strong>USAID food rations were drastically cut.</strong> The boys, classified as "extremely vulnerable," began losing their food support. Violence increased in the camp. <strong>Seven of our boys were forced to leave for their safety or survival.</strong></p>
                   
                   <p>Today, we support <strong>11 students</strong> who remain. They need $400 per month for food, school supplies, and basic survival.</p>
                   
                   <h3>Who Are "Makol's Boys"?</h3>
                   <p>In Kakuma, people call them <strong>Makol's Boys</strong> - not as an official name, but as a community identity. It's a nickname that grew naturally from the bond we share. It reflects connection and responsibility. As my tutor Anika Brennan would always say: <em>"Whatever you learn, teach two other people."</em></p>
                   
                   <p><strong>My vision is to witness these children thrive despite the adversities that swarm around them.</strong> I refuse to accept a reality where their youth becomes a liability. My aim is to foster an environment where they flourish, triumphing over circumstances that unfairly put the odds against them.</p>

           <p class="section-subtitle">Building confidence, character, and a sense of family through daily routines and shared values</p>

                   <h3>Our Daily Routine: Building Confidence & Community</h3>
                   <p>From the start, I have been working on making things keep going, even when I am away. My main job is to give these kids a place they can call home, where they feel loved and share meals. Many of them don't get much school time, so I encourage them to use what they learn in their studies.</p>
                   
                   <p>As most of these kids don't speak English well, and they range from <strong>8 to 16 years old</strong>, I want them to feel confident speaking in public. So we have a routine:</p>
                   
                   <div style="background: white; padding: 2rem; border-radius: 1rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-left: 4px solid #f59e0b;">
                       <h4 style="color: #d97706; margin-bottom: 1rem;">🕐 Evening Routine</h4>
                       <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0;">
                           <li style="padding: 0.75rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #fde68a;">
                               <strong>After Dinner:</strong> Two hours of study time together
                           </li>
                           <li style="padding: 0.75rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #fde68a;">
                               <strong>Family Prayers:</strong> We gather as a family
                           </li>
                           <li style="padding: 0.75rem 0;">
                               <strong>Bible Reading:</strong> Each person reads a verse aloud in English
                           </li>
                       </ul>
                       <p style="margin-top: 1rem; color: #92400e; font-style: italic;">This is about building confidence and speaking skills - creating brave, articulate young people.</p>
                   </div>
                   
                   <h3>Why Family Matters</h3>
                   <p><strong>I believe that when a family prays together, they stick together.</strong> These kids come from different backgrounds, so it's important to keep them close. Even when I'm far away, I teach and guide them, showing that learning is something we do together, no matter the distance.</p>
                   
                   <h3>The Gift They Give Me</h3>
                   <p>In this journey, these remarkable children have given me a profound gift - <strong>an unseen force that fuels my spirit.</strong> Their resilience, their laughter, and their unwavering determination fill me with an energy that knows no bounds.</p>
                   
                   <p>Their trust in my guidance, their genuine smiles, and their pursuit of betterment are the very sources of my unwavering dedication to support and uplift them, each and every day. In this exchange of care and knowledge, they have unknowingly granted me a unique strength - an inner fire that ignites when I witness their progress and unyielding spirit.</p>
                   
                   <p style="background: #fffbeb; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 0.75rem; margin-top: 1.5rem; border-left: 3px solid #f59e0b;">
                       <em>"Their courage to learn despite challenges, their eagerness to absorb knowledge in a world often devoid of opportunities, fuels my own determination to stand by them, no matter the distance."</em>

                   These children have powerful stories to tell. Through their compositions, essays, and creative writing, they process their experiences, express their dreams, and develop confidence. Every piece you read here represents hours of courage, practice, and growth.

               <p style="color: #92400e; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                   In early 2025, <strong>USAID food rations were drastically cut.</strong> The children, classified as "extremely vulnerable," lost critical food support. Violence increased in the camp, and seven boys were forced to leave for safety.
               </p>
               <p style="color: #92400e; line-height: 1.8;">
                   <strong>Your monthly support of $400 keeps 11 students fed, safe, and in school.</strong> It's the difference between survival and crisis. It's the difference between giving up and thriving.
