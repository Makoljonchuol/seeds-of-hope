                   <h3>How It All Began (2019-2021)</h3>
                   <p>Returning to Kakuma in June 2021, after completing my high school education, was a plunge into the unexpected. Having graduated in 2019 with high hopes for college, the sharp reality hit hard — the odds were stacked against me. The Kenyan government's policies offered limited opportunities for "foreign students" like myself.</p>
                   
                   <p>Desperate for a way forward, I grasped onto the chance to teach within the refugee camp. Simultaneously, I became part of the <strong>Elimisha Kakuma program</strong>, headed by three former refugees who pursued education in the United States. At the camp, I shared a bed with a fellow teacher, while fourteen other young boys in our compound looked to me for guidance and education.</p>
                   
                   <p>Each morning, I would go to the Elimisha Center, assuming the role of both a tech support member and a student. Weekends were dedicated to volunteering in schools and hospitals, peeling back layers of this community's reality. <strong>I discovered a harsh truth: many children in the camp faced the raw challenges of refugee life alone.</strong></p>
                   
                   <h3>Building a Family (2021-2023)</h3>
                   <p>In Kakuma, numerous young souls arrive unaccompanied, thrown into a community where living alone is not an option. I met <strong>three boys</strong> who had no family, no shelter, and no support. Their names stayed with me, and their need became my responsibility.</p>
                   
                   <p>With community fundraising, I built a small shelter for them. We added solar panels for light and safety, provided daily meals, and enrolled them in school. Word spread. More children came — children who had lost everything but hope. <strong>At our peak, we were supporting 18 children.</strong> We taught them life skills, discipline, and community values. It wasn't perfect, but it was a home.</p>
                   
                   <h3>The Crisis of 2025</h3>
                   <p>In early 2025, <strong>USAID food rations were drastically cut.</strong> The boys, classified as "extremely vulnerable," began losing their food support. Violence increased in the camp. <strong>Seven of our boys were forced to leave for their safety or survival.</strong></p>
                   
                   <p>Today, we support <strong>11 boys and 1 girl</strong> who remain, plus <strong>3 children from my sister's family</strong> who needed urgent care — a total of <strong>14 children</strong>. They need $400 per month for food, school supplies, and basic survival.</p>
                   
                   <h3>Who Are "Makol's Boys"?</h3>
                   <p>In Kakuma, people call them <strong>Makol's Boys</strong> — not as an official name, but as a community identity. It's a nickname that grew naturally from the bond we share. It reflects connection and responsibility. As my tutor Anika Brennan would always say: <em>"Whatever you learn, teach two other people."</em></p>
                   
                   <p><strong>My vision is to witness these children thrive despite the adversities that swarm around them.</strong> I refuse to accept a reality where their youth becomes a liability. My aim is to foster an environment where they flourish, triumphing over circumstances that unfairly put the odds against them.</p>

               <p style="color: #92400e; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                   In early 2025, <strong>USAID food rations were drastically cut.</strong> The children, classified as "extremely vulnerable," lost critical food support. Violence increased in the camp, and seven boys were forced to leave for safety.
               </p>
               <p style="color: #92400e; line-height: 1.8;">
                   <strong>Your monthly support of $400 keeps 14 children fed, safe, and in school.</strong> It's the difference between survival and crisis. It's the difference between giving up and thriving.
